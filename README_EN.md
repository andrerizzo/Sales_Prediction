# 📈 Sales Forecasting with Time Series

## 🔍 Introduction
This project aims to analyze and forecast sales volume over time based on historical data. Sales forecasting is essential for strategic decision-making in areas such as marketing, logistics, finance, and production.

The study is divided into stages to structure a complete forecasting pipeline, including exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and application of time series models.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze temporal patterns in sales (trend, seasonality, outliers)
- Build univariate forecasting models
- Prepare the project for further development with multivariate or machine learning models

---

## 🧠 Project Stages

### ✅ Part 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data inspection
- Visualization of trend and seasonality
- Stationarity checks

### ✅ Part 2 — Preprocessing
- Date conversion and chronological ordering
- Handling missing values
- Aggregation by time frequency (weekly/monthly)

### ✅ Part 3 — Univariate Models
- Application of classic time series models (e.g., moving average, decomposition, ARIMA)
- Evaluation of forecasting performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAE

---

## 📦 Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- statsmodels
- numpy
- scikit-learn (optional)

---

## 📊 Results
The project demonstrated the feasibility of forecasting sales volumes based on historical patterns. Even simple univariate models showed promising performance, especially for series with clear trends and marked seasonality.

> Quantitative results (e.g., RMSE, MAE) can be included here after final evaluation.

---

## 🔁 Next Steps
- Explore multivariate models (including features like promotions, weather, etc.)
- Test machine learning and deep learning models (Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM)
- Automate the pipeline and export future forecasts
- Create interactive visual dashboards for business reporting
